<a href="https://www.eatbigbuns.com"><h2>Big Buns</h2></a><img src="bigbuns.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt"Big Buns"><p>Big Buns has a simple homepage with high quality food images and a white background that makes the photos stand out. Although the logo is not in the top left corner, it is centered above the navigation and is apparent due to the white color. They use a grid system to alternate food images with their corresponding descriptions. The social media websites and menus for each location are easy to find. The contact form is easy to use.</p>

	<a href="https://www.matchboxrestaurants.com"><h2>Matchbox</h2></a><img src="matchbox.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Matchbox"><p>Matchbox uses high quality photos of their food on their homepage and breaks up the site between scrolling images and a white background using  a grid system. The menus and social media links are easy to find. Each location is listed and allows quick access to information on addresses, hours, menus, private events, and building history. The use of red for online ordering and reservation links makes them stand out.</p>
