		  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<h4>Elizabeth Thakkar</h4>
		  <p>I wasn't one of those people who always knew <br>
				exactly what I wanted to do with my life.<br><br>
				I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology<br> 
				in 2011, with no idea what the future would hold.<br>
				The next year, I found my calling when I began<br>
				volunteering for the National Park Service at<br> 
				Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC.<br><br>
				Since that time, I have worked in multiple parks<br> 
				from regional to state to federal. This led to my<br> 
				obsession with environmental education and<br> 
				documenting nature through photography.<br><br> 
				Currently, I am pursueing a degree in graphic<br> 
				design while working to develop environmental,<br> 
	  			recreation and park-based interpretive media.</p>
